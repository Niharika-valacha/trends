 Project Title

Analyzing and Visualizing Paper Data

 Description

This project involves analyzing and visualizing a dataset of papers. The code performs data cleaning, explores the distribution of papers across different years,
applies advanced text preprocessing techniques, generates a word cloud based on processed titles, and conducts topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
The code also incorporates interactive visualizations using Plotly to showcase the number of papers published each year.



Functionalities

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
   - Handles missing values in the dataset.
   - Explores the distribution of papers across different years using visualizations.

2. Text Preprocessing:
   - Applies advanced text preprocessing techniques, including lemmatization and stop-word removal.

3. Word Cloud:
   - Generates a word cloud based on processed titles.
   - Customizes word cloud appearance.

4. Topic Modeling (LDA):
   - Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
   - Prints and displays the discovered topics.

5. Interactive Visualizations (Plotly):
   - Uses Plotly to create an interactive bar plot showing the number of papers published each year.
 Advanced Functionalities

- NLP Techniques:
  - Utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as lemmatization for improved text processing.

- Enhanced Visualizations:
  - Customizes the appearance of the word cloud.
  - Creates interactive visualizations using Plotly.
